Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes and computational machines.
As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms,
computation and information to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware
and software. Computer science addresses any computational problems, especially information
processes, such as control, communication, perception, learning, and intelligence.
Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. For example, the theory of
computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be
solved using them, while computer graphics and computational geometry emphasize more specific
applications.
